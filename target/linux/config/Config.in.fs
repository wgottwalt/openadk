	  Ext2 is a standard Linux file system for hard disks.

config ADK_KERNEL_EXT3_FS
	tristate "EXT3 filesystem support"
	select ADK_KERNEL_BLOCK
	help
	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called ext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create ext3 journals
	  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

	  If you say Y here, you will be able to mount extended format
	  Macintosh-formatted hard drive partitions with full read-write access.

	  This file system is often called HFS+ and was introduced with
	  MacOS 8. It includes all Mac specific filesystem data such as
	  data forks and creator codes, but it also has several UNIX
	  style features such as file ownership and permissions.

config ADK_KERNEL_NTFS_FS
	tristate "NTFS file system support"
	select ADK_KERNEL_BLOCK
	help
	  NTFS is the file system of Microsoft Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003.

	  Saying Y or M here enables read support.  There is partial, but
	  safe, write support available.  For write support you must also
	  say Y to "NTFS write support" below.

	  There are also a number of user-space tools available, called
	  ntfsprogs.  These include ntfsundelete and ntfsresize, that work
	  without NTFS support enabled in the kernel.

	  This is a rewrite from scratch of Linux NTFS support and replaced
	  the old NTFS code starting with Linux 2.5.11.  A backport to
	  the Linux 2.4 kernel series is separately available as a patch
	  from the project web site.

	  For more information see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt>
	  and <http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/>.

	  If you are not using Windows NT, 2000, XP or 2003 in addition to
	  Linux on your computer it is safe to say N.

	  This option provides support for normal Windows file systems with
	  long filenames.  That includes non-compressed FAT-based file systems
	  used by Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and the Unix
	  programs from the mtools package.

	  The VFAT support enlarges your kernel by about 10 KB Please read the
	  file <file:Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt> for details.

	tristate "XFS filesystem support"

	help
	  XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
	  on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
	  support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
	  variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
	  Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
	  and scalability.

	  Refer to the documentation at <http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/>
	  for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible
	  with the IRIX version of XFS.

	  Btrfs is a general purpose copy-on-write filesystem with extents,
	  writable snapshotting, support for multiple devices and many more
	  features focused on fault tolerance, repair and easy administration.
	  For more information, please see the web pages at

config ADK_KERNEL_FUSE_FS

	help
	  With FUSE it is possible to implement a fully functional
	  filesystem in a userspace program.

	  By enabling this, only the kernel module gets build.
	  For using it, you will most likely also want to enable
	  fuse-utils.

	  This is the standard file system used on CD-ROMs.  It was previously
	  known as "High Sierra File System" and is called "hsfs" on other
	  Unix systems.  The so-called Rock-Ridge extensions which allow for
	  long Unix filenames and symbolic links are also supported by this
	  driver.  If you have a CD-ROM drive and want to do more with it than
	  just listen to audio CDs and watch its LEDs, say Y (and read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/isofs.txt> and the CD-ROM-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), thereby
	  enlarging your kernel by about 27 KB; otherwise say N.
