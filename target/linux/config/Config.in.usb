	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.
	  
	  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the
	  leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs.
	  Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals
	  such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks,
	  flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.

	  Say Y here if your computer has a host-side USB port and you want
	  to use USB devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of the
	  Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1
	  controller, such as "UHCI HCD support" or "OHCI HCD support",
	  and "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" except for older systems that
	  do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select
	  them all if you are not certain.

	  If your system has a device-side USB port, used in the peripheral
	  side of the USB protocol, see the "USB Gadget" framework instead.

	  After choosing your HCD, then select drivers for the USB peripherals
	  you'll be using.  You may want to check out the information provided
	  in <file:Documentation/usb/> and especially the links given in
	  <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.txt>.

	  The Universal Host Controller Interface is a standard by Intel for
	  accessing the USB hardware in the PC (which is also called the USB
	  host controller). If your USB host controller conforms to this
	  standard, you may want to say Y, but see below. All recent boards
	  with Intel PCI chipsets (like intel 430TX, 440FX, 440LX, 440BX,
	  i810, i820) conform to this standard. Also all VIA PCI chipsets
	  (like VIA VP2, VP3, MVP3, Apollo Pro, Apollo Pro II or Apollo Pro
	  133). If unsure, say Y.

	  The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is a standard for accessing
	  USB 1.1 host controller hardware.  It does more in hardware than Intel's
	  UHCI specification.  If your USB host controller follows the OHCI spec,
	  say Y.  On most non-x86 systems, and on x86 hardware that's not using a
	  USB controller from Intel or VIA, this is appropriate.  If your host
	  controller doesn't use PCI, this is probably appropriate.  For a PCI
	  based system where you're not sure, the "lspci -v" entry will list the
	  right "prog-if" for your USB controller(s):  EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI.

	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.  At the time of this writing, 
	  the primary implementation of EHCI is a chip from NEC, widely available
	  in add-on PCI cards, but implementations are in the works from other 
	  vendors including Intel and Philips.  Motherboard support is appearing.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.
