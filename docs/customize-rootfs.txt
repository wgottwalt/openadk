Customizing the generated target filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides changing one or another configuration through +make menuconfig+,
there is a way to customize the resulting target filesystem.

Create a new directory called +extra+ in the top OpenADK directory.
Put there a tree of directories and files that will be copied directly
over the target filesystem (+root_*+) after everything is build, but
before the firmware images or archives are created.

You can also point to another directory via:
---------------
 $ make extra=/foo/bar
---------------

You can start with the example configuration files from +root_*+.
The +extra+ directory will never be deleted by any clean target to avoid
loss of customized configuration data.

Another option is to configure a post-build action. This is available
in +Global settings+. It must point to a script relative to the root
of your openadk working copy. It will be invoked as part of the
+-imageinstall+ step with $ADK_TOPDIR as first argument. You can use
it e.g. to modify the +root_*+ filesystem before bundling it.
