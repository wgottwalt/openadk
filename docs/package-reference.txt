+package+ Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of variables that can be set in a +Makefile+ to give metadata
information is: 

* +PKG_NAME+, mandatory, must contain the name of the package.

* +PKG_VERSION+, mandatory, must contain the version of the package.

* +PKG_RELEASE+, mandatory, must contain the OpenADK specific release of the package.

* +PKG_HASH+, mandatory, must contain the SHA256 hash of the package, will be used
  to check if a download of a package is complete.

* +PKG_SECTION+, mandatory, must contain the OpenADK specific section, see package/section.lst.

* +PKG_RELEASE+, mandatory, must contain an one line summary of the package description.

* +PKG_URL+, optional, may contain the url to the homepage of the package

* +PKG_SITES+, mandatory, must contain the download url for the package, multiple entries
  with space separated, are allowed. Only HTTP/HTTPS or FTP URLS are allowed.
  A backup site (http://www.openadk.org/distfiles) is always used, if the package site is
  not available. There is no direct support for cvs/svn/git/hg/bzr repositories, because 
  building OpenADK behind a HTTP proxy should be working without any configuration hassle.
  There are also some predefined mirror sites in +mk/mirrors.mk+,
  which can be used.
  Example: PKG_SITES:=		+${MASTER_SITE_GNU:=foo/}+

* +DISTFILES+ optional, may contain the name of the tarball of
  the package. If +DISTFILES+ is not specified, it defaults to +PKG_NAME-PKG_VERSION.tar.xz+. 
  Example: DISTFILES=		+${PKG_NAME}${PKG_VERSION}.tar.gz+

* +NO_DISTFILES+ optional, may be set to 1, to disable fetching of any archives.
  Provide the source code for the package in +package/<pkgname>/src+, which will be
  automatically copied to the WRKBUILD/WRKSRC directory.

* +PKG_BUILDDEP+ optional, lists the build time dependencies (in terms of package
  directory name, see +package/+) that are required for the current target package to
  compile. These dependencies are guaranteed to be compiled and
  installed before the configuration of the current package starts.

* +PKG_DEPENDS+ optional, lists the runtime dependencies that are required to
  run the software package on the target. It contains a list of package names,
  which might be different to the package directory name. See what is used
  in PKG_template, to find out the package name used here.

* +PKG_KDEPENDS+ optional, lists the kernel module dependencies that are required to
  run the software package on the target. It contains a list of kernel module names
  in lower case as used in +target/linux/config+. (use minus instead of underscores)

* +PKG_NEEDS+ optional, lists the features that are required to build or
  run the software package on the target. It contains a list of keywords.
  Supported are +threads+ +mmu+ +intl+ and +c+++

* +PKG_NOPARALLEL+ optional, may be set to 1, to disable parallel building of the
  package via make -jn, n=4 is default, but can be changed in +Global Settings+ in the
  menu based configuration.

* +PKG_OPTS+ optional, may be set to following values: 
     +dev+ create a development package automatically, containing header files and +.pc+ files. 
		Only useful for library packages, when you want to compile on the target.
     +devonly+ only creates a development package with header files, normally not needed on
		the target.
     +noscripts+ do not automatically install *-config and other build related scripts into
     		+STAGING_TARGET_DIR/scripts+, required for automake/autoconf package
     +noremove+ do not automatically remove package files from +STAGING_TARGET_DIR+

The recommended way to define these variables is to use the following
syntax:

----------------------
PKG_VERSION:=		2.11
----------------------

Or for lines longer than 80 characters use:
----------------------
PKG_DEPENDS:=		foo bar baz
PKG_DEPENDS+=		muh maeh
----------------------


The variables that define what should be performed at the
different steps of the configure, build and install process.

* +CONFIG_STYLE+ manual, auto, minimal, basic, perl or cmake

* +CONFIGURE_ARGS+ add --enable-foo/--disable-foo to configure

* +CONFIGURE_ENV+ add additional environment variables to configure step

* +HOST_STYLE+ either manual or auto

* +HOST_CONFIGURE_ARGS+ add --enable-foo/--disable-foo to host configure

* +HOST_CONFIGURE_ENV+ add additional environment variables to the host configure step

* +AUTOTOOL_STYLE+ either autoreconf, autoconf or bootstrap

* +BUILD_STYLE+ either manual or auto

* +MAKE_ENV+ add additional variables to build step

* +MAKE_FLAGS+ add additinal make flags to build step

* +FAKE_FLAGS+ add additional make flags to fake install step

* +XAKE_FLAGS+ add additional make flags to build and fake install step

* +INSTALL_STYLE+ either manual or auto

* +CONFIGURE_PROG+ overwrite default configure programm

* +MAKE_FILE+ overwrite default Makefile

* +ALL_TARGET+ overwrite default build target

* +INSTALL_TARGET+ overwrite default install target

The variables to add or overwrite preprocessor, compiler and linker flags:

* +TARGET_CPPFLAGS+ flags for the preprocessor

* +TARGET_CFLAGS+ flags for the compiler

* +TARGET_LDFLAGS+ flags for the linker

* +TARGET_CXXFLAGS+ flags for the C++ compiler

* +HOST_CPPFLAGS+ flags used for host preprocessing

* +HOST_CFLAGS+ flags used for host compiling

* +HOST_LDFLAGS+ flags used for host linking

* +HOST_CXXFLAGS+ flags for the C++ host compiler
